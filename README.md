# WTWR (What to Wear)

WTWR is a responsive React-based weather app that helps users decide what to wear based on the current weather. Users can add clothing items to a personal wardrobe, which are then filtered and displayed according to the current temperature and weather conditions, fetched via a live Weather API.

## Features

- Real-time weather detection based on user's location (using Weather API)
- Add, view, and delete clothing cards with name, image, and weather type
- Cards are automatically sorted by weather conditions (hot, warm, cold)
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Built with React, with modular and reusable components
- User Authentication
- Like other users clothing items to get inspiration for your own wardrobe!

## Technologies Used

- React
- JavaScript
- CSS
- Vite
- Weather API
- Node.js/Express (backend)
- MongoDB

### Future Implementations

1. Live Location - Currently, the location is hardcoded using a set of coordinates, but in future iterations, I would like to allow the user's device to use their current location.

2. Edit Cards - I would like to give the users the ability to edit the clothing item cards, so that if there is a spelling error, they can simply fix it, rather than have to make a whole new card.

3. Filter Options - Giving the user the ability to add filter options to their clothing item gallery, so that if there are a bunch of cards that overflow the screen, they can quickly find a "RED SHIRT" instead of having to scroll through the entire list.
